## Your Task

Generate an engaging opening scene for this adventure. The scene should:

1. **Set the Stage**: Establish the setting, atmosphere, and immediate situation
2. **Hook the Player**: Create intrigue or a compelling reason to engage
3. **Present Options**: End with a clear situation where the player can make meaningful choices
4. **Incorporate Initial Cards**: Naturally introduce any characters or locations from the story cards that would logically be present at the start

## Guidelines

- Begin in media res when possible - start with action or an interesting moment
- Use sensory details to make the scene vivid
- Don't overwhelm with exposition - reveal the world through action and observation
- The player should feel like they have agency from the first moment
- Keep the opening to 3-5 paragraphs

## Output Format

Write the opening scene in second person narrative prose. Do not include instructions or meta-commentary.
